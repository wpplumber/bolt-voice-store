# TinyKicks - AI Voice-Powered Vendure Store

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/68445607-74fa-456a-a34b-8904e20d5bc2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/bolt-hackathon-tarikrital/deploys)

## About the Project

**TinyKicks** is an innovative e-commerce platform that combines modern web technologies with AI-powered voice search to create a seamless shopping experience. Built for the Bolt.new Hackathon, this project demonstrates the future of conversational commerce.

## What is the Aim

Observing how parents shop for their children - often while multitasking, holding babies, or in situations where traditional typing and clicking interfaces are inconvenient. I created a shopping experience that feels as natural as asking a friend for recommendations.

The vision is to build a store where parents could simply say "Show me running shoes under $50" or "Find comfortable shoes for my toddler" and get intelligent, personalized results with natural voice responses.

## What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into several cutting-edge technologies:

### ðŸŽ¤ Voice AI Integration
- **Speech Recognition**: Implemented both Web Speech API and ElevenLabs for robust voice input
- **Text-to-Speech**: Used ElevenLabs' premium voices with Web Speech API fallback
- **Natural Language Processing**: Built custom parsing logic to understand shopping queries

### ðŸ›’ E-commerce Backend Integration
- **Vendure Integration**: Connected to a live Vendure e-commerce backend
- **GraphQL**: Implemented type-safe GraphQL queries for products and collections
- **Real-time Data**: Built dynamic product search with live inventory data

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern Frontend Architecture
- **Astro Framework**: Leveraged Astro's island architecture for optimal performance
- **Vue.js Components**: Created interactive components with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI**: Implemented responsive, accessible design system

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Development Practices
- **TypeScript**: Maintained type safety across the entire application
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized code into clean, reusable services and components
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust fallback systems for voice features

## How I Built It

### Architecture Overview
```
Frontend (Astro + Vue) â†’ Voice Services â†’ Vendure Backend
                      â†“
                 ElevenLabs API
```

### Key Components Built

#### 1. **Voice Search System**
- **VoiceSearchModal.vue**: Full-screen voice interface with real-time feedback
- **VendureVoiceService.ts**: Core service handling speech-to-text, product search, and text-to-speech
- **Smart Query Parsing**: Extracts price ranges, categories, and keywords from natural language

#### 2. **E-commerce Integration**
- **Vendure GraphQL Client**: Type-safe connection to live product database
- **Dynamic Product Display**: Real-time product cards with live inventory status
- **Category Management**: Automatic category detection from Vendure collections

#### 3. **User Experience Features**
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces
- **Loading States**: Shimmer effects and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when voice features aren't available
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

#### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Astro Islands**: Only hydrate interactive components
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading with Pexels integration
- **Caching Strategy**: Smart caching of product data and categories

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Voice Query Processing
```typescript
// Example of natural language parsing
"Show me running shoes under $50" â†’ {
  category: "running",
  maxPrice: 50,
  keywords: ["shoes"]
}
```

### Real-time Product Search
- Connected to live Vendure instance at `vendure.tarikrital.website`

**Solution**: 
- Implemented smart caching strategies
- Built type-safe GraphQL integration
- Created fallback mock data system

### 3. **Natural Language Understanding**
**Challenge**: Parsing diverse shopping queries accurately.

**Solution**:
- Built custom NLP logic for e-commerce context
- Implemented fuzzy matching for categories
- Added smart synonym detection

### 4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
**Challenge**: Voice features work differently across browsers.

**Solution**:
- Comprehensive feature detection
- Multiple fallback layers
- Progressive enhancement approach

### 5. **TypeScript Integration**
**Challenge**: Maintaining type safety with dynamic GraphQL responses.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Implemented proper type assertions
- Built type-safe service layer
